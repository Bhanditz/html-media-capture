      This specification defines Application Programming Interfaces (<acronym title='Application Programming Interface'>API</acronym>)
      that provides access to the image and video capture capabilities of the device.

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        The Camera API:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>MUST enable capture of static images</li>
        <li>MUST enable capture of videos</li>
        <li>MUST enable listing the available cameras</li>
        <li>MUST enable listing the available formats and codecs, per camera</li>
        <li>MUST enable retrieval of the captured content</li>
        <li>MUST provide some metadata about the captured content (e.g. width, height, format, duration)</li>
        <li>MUST enable choosing preferred aspects of the captured content (e.g. width, height, format, frame rate)</li>
        <li>MUST enable displaying a viewfinder</li>
        <li>MUST support asynchronous, cancellable capture</li>
        <li>SHOULD enable displaying a viewfinder as part of the document (e.g. as a <code>video</code> element [[HTML5]])</li>
        <li>SHOULD enable control of the camera's capabilities (e.g. zoom, luminosity, night mode, focus mode)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class='issue'>
        Given support for capturing video, we need to take sound capture into account. Once that's supported,
        is there any reason not to support capturing sound on its own? If we go there, isn't this a Capture API,
        with the ability to list mikes?
      </p>
      <div class='issue'>
        <p>
          If the user requests a given capture size which isn't available, do we refuse or do we fall back? If the
          latter (which is likely) what is the algorithm that is used to find the fallback? It could be (given a request
          for 1000x50):
          <ul>
            <li>the camera's preferred default</li>
            <li>500x100 (closest number of pixels)</li>
            <li>1000x700 (closest longest side)</li>
            <li>2000x100 (closest ratio)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class='issue'>
        We could very easily get bogged down in specifying camera capabilities and format feature variants â€” 
        how do we decide which ones are reasonably in?
