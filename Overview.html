      This specification defines HTML form enhancements that provide access to the audio, image and video capture

    <section id="sotd">
<p>This document is a the first part of the split of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-capture-api-20100401/">previous version</a>
of this document, focused on the integration of media capture in HTML
forms based on an extension to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/">FileAPI</a>. The second part of the split focused on programmatic access to the capture devices will be published separately.</p>

<p>The Working Group is looking for feedback on the general approach of
this new version, and will coordinate with the HTML and Web Applications
Working Group to ensure the proper progress of this document.</p>

<p>Issues and editors notes in the document highlight some of the points on
which the group is still working and would particularly like to get
feedback.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The HTML Form Based Media Capturing specification defines a new
    interface for media files, a new parameter for the accept attribute of the HTML input element in file upload state, and recommendations for
    providing optimized access to the microphone and camera of a
    hosting device.</p> 

    <p>Providing streaming access to these capabilities is outside of the scope of this specification.</p>
    <p class="note">The Working Group is investigating the opportunity to specify streaming access via the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-device/">proposed <code>&lt;device&gt;</code> element</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the
        interfaces that it contains.
      </p>
      <p>

        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in this specification must implement them in a manner consistent
        with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as this specification uses that specification and
        terminology.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section id="security">
    <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
    <p>This specification builds upon the security and privacy protections provided by the [[!HTML5]] <code>&lt;input type="file"&gt;</code> and the [[!FILE-API]] specifications; in particular, it is expected that any offer to start capturing content from the user’s device would require a specific user interaction on an HTML element that is entirely controlled by the user agent.</p>

    <p>In addition to the requirements already highlighted in the [[!HTML5]] and [[!FILE-API]] specifications, implementors should take care of additional leakage of privacy-sensitive data from captured media. For instance, embedding the user’s location in a captured media metadata (e.g. EXIF) might transmit more private data than the user might be expecting.</p>

    </section>


  <section id="formaccess">
    <h2>Capture aware file-select control</h2>

    <p>This section is normative.</p>

    <p class="note">[[!HTML5]] <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/number-state.html#file-upload-state">links <code>&lt;input type="file"&gt;</code></a> to the File interface. This specification defines a refined <code>MediaFile</code> interface to be used when the <code>accept</code> attribute take certain values — this will require coordination with the HTML5 Working Group.</p>

    <p>If input element in the File Upload state [[!HTML5]] contains
    accept attribute with values <code>image/*</code>,
    <code>sound/*</code>, or <code>video/*</code>, the user agent can
    invoke a file picker that allows respectively the user to take a
    picture, record a sound file, or record a video in addition to
    selecting an existing file from the file system.</p>

    <p>See the <a href="#uiexamples">User Interface Examples</a> appendix for the illustration.

    <p>In case the user chooses to capture video, audio, or image
    content, the user agent creates media files on the fly <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/number-state.html#file-upload-state">as
    specified</a> in [[HTML5]].</p>

    <p>If the user selects files of whose MIME types match <code>image/*</code>,
    <code>sound/*</code>, or <code>video/*</code> (on the filesystem or via a successful media capture), the relevant files in the <code>files</code> attribute [[HTML5]] MUST implement the <code>MediaFile</code> interface.</p>

    <pre class="example sh_javascript_dom">&lt;input type="file" accept="image/*"&gt; </pre>
</section>

  <section id="captureparam">
    <h2>The <code>capture</code> parameter</h2>

    <p>This section is normative.</p>


    <p>The <code>capture</code> parameter may be specified on the media type values of the <code>accept</code> attribute to provide user agents with a hint of that by the default a file picker should be in media capturing mode.</p>

    <p class="note">[[!HTML5]] <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/number-state.html#attr-input-accept">defines the <code>accept</code> attribute to take no parameters on MIME types</a>. This specification proposes to use a MIME type parameter — this will require coordination with the HTML5 Working Group.</p>


    <p>The <code>capture</code> parameter can take one of the following values: <code>camera</code>, <code>camcorder</code>, <code>microphone</code>, <code>filesystem</code>. These values indicate which source the file picker interface should preferably present to the user by default.</p>
    <p class="note">The values and their exact meaning are still very much in flux.</p>

    <p>For example, the following code indicates that the user is expected to upload an image from the device camera:</p>
    <pre class="example sh_javascript_dom">&lt;input type="file" accept="image/*;capture=camera"&gt; </pre>
    <p>A possible rendering of a file picker taking this parameter into account is offered in the <a href="#uiexamples">User Interface Examples appendix</a>.</p>

    <h2>WebIDL interfaces</h2>

    <section id="mediafile"><h3><a>MediaFile</a> interface</h3>

    <p><code>MediaFile</code> captures a single photo, video or sound
    captured by the device. It inherits
    from <code>File</code> [[!FILE-API]].</p>

    <dl title="[NoInterfaceObject] interface MediaFile : File" class="idl">

    <dt>readonly attribute FormatData format </dt>

    <dd>The format attribute represents the format information of <a
    href="#formatdata"><code>MediaFile</code></a>
    object.
    <p class="note">The Working Group is considering whether the indirection provided by the <code>format</code> attribute is useful or if the <code>MediaFile</code> interface should inherit directly from <code>FormatData</code>.</p>
    </dd></dl>

    </section>

    <section  id="formatdata"><h3><a>FormatData</a> interface</h3>

    <p><code>FormatData</code> captures format information of a media
    file captured by the device.</p>

    <p class="note">The relationship between this <code>FormatData</code> interface and the properties made available through the API for Media Resource 1.0 [[MEDIAONT-API]] needs further investigation.</p>

    <dl title="[NoInterfaceObject] interface FormatData" class="idl">

      <dt>attribute DOMString codecs</dt>
      <dd>The type attribute of the Blob interface (inherited from the File interface) is not sufficient to determine the format of the
      content since it only specifies the container type. The codecs attribute
      represents the actual format that the audio and video of the content.
      The codecs attribute MUST conform to the [[!RFC4281]].
      For example, a valid value for H.263 video and AAC low
      complexity would be codecs="s263, mp4a.40.2".</dd>

      <dt>attribute unsigned long bitrate </dt>
      <dd>The codecs attribute only specifies the profile and level of the encoded content
      which doesn't specify the actual bitrate. It only specifies the maximum encoded 
      bitrate, thus this bitrate attribute is the average bitrate of the content. In the case
      of an image this attribute has value 0.</dd>

      <dt>attribute unsigned long height </dt>
      <dd>The height attribute represents height of the image or video
      in pixels. In the case of a sound clip this attribute has value 0.</dd>

      <dt>attribute unsigned long width </dt>
      <dd>The width attribute represents width of the image or video
      in pixels. In the case of a sound clip this attribute has value 0.</dd>

      <dt>attribute double duration </dt>
      <dd>The duration attribute represents length of the video or sound
      clip in milliseconds. In the case of an image this attribute has value 0.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p class="note">Some of the proposed attributes of the <code>FormatData</code> interface could possibly be integrated as parameters of the MIME type, or as MIME options object.</p>
