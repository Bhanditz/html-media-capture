      The <cite>HTML Media Capture</cite> specification defines HTML form
      extensions that facilitate user access to media capture capabilities of
      the hosting device. These form extensions enable the upload of still
      images, video, and audio directly from a device capture mechanism but
      capture the default offered by the device, providing limited control
      over what is captured. More detailed control, including management of
      related streams, is provided by the
      <cite>Media Capture and Streams</cite> specification [[GETUSERMEDIA]].
    </section>
    
    <section id="sotd">
      <p>
        This specification covers a subset of the media capture functionality being worked on
        by the DAP WG. It is specifically designed to be simple and declarative.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The <cite>HTML Media Capture</cite> specification enables web page
        authors to declaratively specify the upload of audio, video and still
        images by adding a new attribute to the HTML <code>input</code>
        element. This enables unified capture and upload from the device
        capture device without requiring a user to save a file and then upload
        it in separate steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such an approach does not provide detailed user control over capture,
        so use cases requiring correlating specific individual audio and video
        streams may be met by using another specification, <cite>Media Capture
        and Streams</cite> [[GETUSERMEDIA]]. Access to media streams from the
        hosting device is out of scope for this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification extends the <code><a>HTMLInputElement</a></code>
        interface with a new <code><a>capture</a></code> attribute. The
        <code><a>capture</a></code> attribute enables content authors to
        indicate the media to be captured and uploaded, specifically still
        images, video, and audio. Conformant user agents provide their users a
        more seamless access to the above-mentioned media capture capabilities
        of the hosting device.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that
        it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
        this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]],
        as this specification uses that specification and terminology.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/the-input-element.html#the-input-element">
        <code><dfn>input</dfn></code> element</a> and the

        The 
        <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/states-of-the-type-attribute.html#file-upload-state-(type=file)">
        <dfn>File Upload</dfn></a> <a>state</a> is defined in [[!HTML5]].

        The
        <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/common-microsyntaxes.html#enumerated-attribute">
        <dfn>enumerated attribute</dfn></a> microsyntax, and associated terms
        and concepts <dfn>keyword</dfn>, <dfn>state</dfn>, <dfn>invalid value
        default</dfn>, and <dfn>missing value default</dfn>, are defined in
        [[!HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p>
        In this specification, the term <dfn>capture control type</dfn>
        refers to a specialized type of a file picker control that is
        optimized, for the user, for capturing media of a specified type.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="security">
      <h2>Security and privacy considerations</h2>
      <p>
        The user agent should not enable any device for media capture, such as
        a microphone or camera, until a user interaction giving implicit
        consent is completed. A user agent should also provide an indication
        when such an input device is enabled and make it possible to terminate
        such capture. Similarly, the user agent should allow the user:
        <ul>
          <li>
            to select the exact media capture device to be used if there exists
            multiple devices of the same type (e.g. a front-facing camera in
            addition to a primary camera).
          </li>
          <li>
            to disable sound capture when in the video capture mode.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        This specification builds upon the security and privacy protections
        provided by the <code>&lt;input type="file"&gt;</code> [[!HTML5]] and
        the [[!FILE-API]] specifications; in particular, it is expected that
        any offer to start capturing content from the user’s device would
        require a specific user interaction on an HTML element that is entirely
        controlled by the user agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementors should take care of additional leakage of privacy-sensitive
        data from captured media. For instance, embedding the user’s location in
        a captured media metadata (e.g. EXIF) might transmit more private data
        than the user might be expecting.
      </p>

      <h2>The capture attribute</h2>
      <p>This section is normative.</p>
      <p>
        When an <code><a>input</a></code> element's <code>type</code> attribute is in
        the <a>File Upload</a> <a>state</a>, the rules in this section apply.
      </p>
      <dl title="partial interface HTMLInputElement" class="idl">
        <dt>attribute DOMString <dfn>capture</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        When the <code><dfn>capture</dfn></code> attribute is specified, the
        <a>user agent</a> SHOULD invoke a file picker of the specific
        <a>capture control type</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code><a>capture</a></code> attribute controls the capture
        <a>state</a> (and associated <a>capture control type</a>) of the
        element. It is an <a>enumerated attribute</a>. The following table
        lists the <a>keyword</a>s, <a>state</a>s, and corresponding <a>capture
        control type</a>s for the attribute. The <a>keyword</a>s
        <code><dfn>camera</dfn></code>, <code><dfn>camcorder</dfn></code>,
        <code><dfn>microphone</dfn></code>, and <code><dfn>filesystem
        </dfn></code> map to the corresponding <a>state</a>s:
        <dfn>Image Capture</dfn>, <dfn>Video Capture</dfn>, <dfn>Sound
        Capture</dfn>, and <a>File Upload</a> respectively.

        The <code><a>capture</a></code> attribute's <em><a>invalid value
        default</a></em> and <em><a>missing value default</a></em> is the
        <a>File Upload</a> <a>state</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>HTMLInputElement</code> interface's <code>accept</code>
        attribute takes precedence over the <code><a>capture</a></code>
        attribute. That is, if the <code>accept</code> attribute's value is set
        to a MIME type that is not accepted in a defined capture <a>state</a>,
        the <a>user agent</a> MUST act as if there was no <code><a>capture</a>
        </code> attribute.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        Use of the <code>capture</code> attribute as defined in
        this specification enables integrated capture and upload of audio,
        video and still images, and complements the following behavior defined
        in the <a>File Upload</a> <a>state</a> [[!HTML5]]:
        User agents may use the value of [the <code>accept</code>] attribute to
        display a more appropriate user interface than a generic file picker.
        For instance, given the value <code>image/*</code>, a user agent could
        offer the user the option of using a local camera or selecting a
        photograph from their photo collection; given the value
        <code>audio/*,</code> a user agent could offer the user the option of
        recording a clip using a headset microphone.

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
      The following examples demostrate how to give hints that it is preferred
      for the user to capture media of a specific MIME type using the media
      capture capabilities of the hosting device. To give a hint that it is
      preferred for the user:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To take a picture using the device's local camera, and upload the
        picture taken:
        <pre class="example sh_html">
          &lt;input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="camera"&gt;
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        To capture video using the device's local video camera, and upload the
        video file captured:
        <pre class="example sh_html">
          &lt;input type="file" accept="video/*" capture="camcorder"&gt;
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        To capture audio using the device's local microphone, and upload the
        audio file captured:
        <pre class="example sh_html">
          &lt;input type="file" accept="audio/*" capture="microphone"&gt;
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When an <code><a>input</a></code> element's <code><a>capture</a></code>
      attribute is in the <a>Image Capture</a> <a>state</a>, the file picker
      may render as presented on the right side. When the attribute is in the
      <a>File Upload</a> <a>state</a>, the generic file picker may render as
      represented on the left side.
